## 💻 Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker

 **#FUTURE_INTERNS**

📊 **Social Media Campaign Performance Tracker**
This repository contains the source files for a strategic Power BI dashboard designed to rigorously monitor, analyze, and optimize the performance and profitability of ad campaigns across major social media channels.

✨ Project Overview

The dashboard provides a visual, interactive interface for exploring complex campaign data (primarily Facebook/Instagram) to extract **actionable insights**. The central goal was to determine the **most profitable ad campaign segments** by defining and calculating accurate metrics like **Return on Investment (ROI)** and **Click-Through Rate (CTR)** across various audiences and channels.

🛠️ Components

The project consists of the following primary artifacts:

File/Artifact 

Description 

**Facebook analysis.pbix**  

The main report file, which contains: A robust 

**Dual Data Model** integrating two disparate datasets (T1 & T2).\</li\>\<li\>Complex **DAX measures** for advanced KPI calculation (e.g., Accurate CPA, ROI).

A **4-page strategic dashboard** covering performance, geography, and competitive benchmarking.
Layout: Structured pages for intuitive data exploration and drill-down analysis.
**Campaign Datasets (T1 & T2)**  The raw performance data files used as separate fact tables in the Power BI model. These files contain the transactional and performance data necessary for comprehensive cross-campaign analysis. 

**Skill Area,Tools & Technologies**

 Skill Area  Tools & Technologies 
 **Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)**  Measures and Calculated Columns for advanced KPIs (e.g., Accurate CPA, ROI), Metric Standardization across disparate datasets. 
 **Data Visualization**  Power BI Desktop, Multi-Page Strategic Dashboard Design, Geographical Mapping (Filled Map), Interactive Reporting. 
 **Data Modeling**  Dual Data Integration (Disparate Fact Tables), Star Schema Design Principles, Relationship Management. 
 **Strategic Analysis**  Cross-Channel Benchmarking, Optimization Insights, Budget Scaling Recommendations. 

🔑 Key Features

  * **Advanced KPI Definition:** Utilizes complex, mathematically correct DAX measures to calculate **Accurate CPA** and **ROI**, ensuring precise profitability metrics across all audience and campaign segments.
  * **Geographical Profitability:** Integrated regional data to visualize campaign success using a **Filled Map**, isolating top-performing cities for immediate budget scaling on the Facebook channel.
  * **Optimization Insights:** Delivers granular, data-backed analysis that clearly identifies high-ROI/low-CPA **Campaign IDs** and **Audience Segments** ready for immediate investment decisions.
  * **Cross-Channel Benchmark:** Provides strategic context by benchmarking Facebook’s ROI and Spend against three competitor channels (**Instagram, Twitter, and Pinterest**).
  * **Data Model & Preparation:** Developed a resilient model that integrates two disparate campaign datasets (T1 & T2) as separate fact tables for comprehensive analysis without relying on traditional joins.
